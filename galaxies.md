## SDSS
SDSS is a large scale image dataset with 306006 galaxies with various shapes and types, taken from Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

DESCRIPTION

A dataset of 306 006 galaxies whose coordinates are taken from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000) Data Release 7 (Abazajian et al. 2009) and a modified catalogue from Wilman et al. (2010). This volume complete sample has an 𝑟-band absolute magnitude limit of 𝑀𝑟 ≤ −20 and a redshift limit of 𝑧 ≤ 0.08. See Arora et al. (2019) for details. This catalogue covers a wide range of environments from clusters to groups and field systems. As in the PROBES dataset, the galaxy images are taken from DESI (Dey et al. 2019). We use this dataset and the corresponding trained model to compare population level galaxy statistics (Sec. 4.1). For brevity we refer to this as the ‘SDSS’ dataset.
